        <summary>What is offsides?</summary>
        <div class="details-wrapper">
          <p>
            Short Answer: Whatever the ref says it is. &#x1F602;
          </p>
          <p>
            Offsides is designed to prevent cherry-picking. So when the ball is kicked,
            the recipient of the pass must have <i>two</i> people from the other team, or the ball,
            between her and the goal. Usually one of those two is the goalkeeper, so it almost always
            comes down to this: <i>The receiving player cannot be past the last defender and the ball 
            <b>when the ball is kicked.</b></i> 
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, game situations get more complicated. There's no offsides for corners
            and throw-ins or if the other team 'deliberately played' the ball, or if you are
            on your own half, but there IS offsides if the other team deflects or saves the
            ball, or if the ball is tipped after a corner or throw-in. And what does 'being past' 
            the defender really mean? Good luck.

        <summary>Do we need a physical?</summary>
        <div class="details-wrapper">
          <p>
          Yes. It's required for all athletes to get a sports physical from a medical professional once a year in order to practice and compete. The physical is good for multiple sports in that year.
          </p>
          <p>
          Common places to get a physical are pharmacies, clinics, primary care physicians, and Wal-Mart.

            <b>HS:</b> Only high school students may play for the high school team, according to <a href="https://khsaa.org/common_documents/handbook/bylaws.pdf">KHSAA rules 4(2)(j)</a>. This is different from other HS sports, where middle schoolers are allowed to play on the high school team.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>MS:</b> We allow students who will be in the 4th-8th grade during the season
            to join the team.
            Playing time in games and starting lineup selection may be limited
            for athletes still in Elementary school, depending on the athlete, the needs of the
            team, and the game situation. Our goal is for the athletes to learn soccer skills while
            staying safe.

            athletic wear for practices.
